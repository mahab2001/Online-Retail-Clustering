Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic/transactional attributes. By identifying meaningful clusters, businesses can design targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and maximize revenue.

Segmentation is one of the most common real-world use cases of unsupervised learning, especially in retail, e-commerce, and financial services.

🛠️ Business Problem

Companies often treat all customers the same, leading to inefficient marketing campaigns, wasted resources, and missed opportunities. Customer segmentation allows businesses to:

Identify high-value customers.

Understand customer needs and preferences.

Design personalized promotions.

Improve cross-selling and upselling strategies.

🔍 Approach

Data Collection

The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, purchase history, and spending patterns.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

Scaling numerical features (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of features.

Correlation analysis.

Identifying trends and anomalies.

Feature Engineering

Creating behavioral metrics (e.g., total spend, average purchase value, recency of last purchase, frequency).

Normalizing variables for clustering.

Clustering Models

K-Means Clustering.

Hierarchical Clustering.

DBSCAN (for anomaly detection and irregular groups).

The optimal number of clusters was determined using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Evaluation & Insights

Interpreting clusters based on meaningful business attributes.

Profiling customer segments (e.g., “High spenders”, “Discount seekers”, “Infrequent buyers”).

📊 Results

Customers were grouped into X clusters with clear behavioral differences.

Example (hypothetical):

Cluster 1: High-value loyal customers (frequent purchases, high spend).

Cluster 2: Price-sensitive customers (low spend, high response to discounts).

Cluster 3: Inactive customers (long recency, low frequency).

These insights can directly guide marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and product recommendations.

🚀 Tech Stack

Python

📈 Business Impact

By applying this customer segmentation model, businesses can:

Increase marketing ROI through targeted campaigns.

Enhance customer satisfaction with personalized experiences.

Boost revenue by identifying and nurturing high-value customers.

Reduce churn by re-engaging inactive customers.
